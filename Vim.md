# VIM Editor Modes

Vim is an editor to create or edit a text file. There are two modes in vim. One is the command mode and another is the insert mode. In the command mode, user can move around the file, delete text, etc. In the insert mode, user can insert text. Changing mode from one to another. From command mode to insert mode type a/A/i/I/o/O ( see details below). From insert mode to command mode type Esc (escape key)

Pasting Text using Put

Often, when you delete or cut text, you may wish to reinsert it in another location of the document. The Put command will paste in the last portion of text that was deleted since deleted text is stored in a buffer. To use this command, place the cursor where you wish the deleted text to appear. Then use p to reinsert the text. If you are inserting a line or paragraph use the lower case p to insert on the line below the cursor or upper case P to place in on the line above the cursor.

Copying Text with Yank

If you wish to make a duplicate copy of existing text, you may use the yank and put commands to accomplish this function. Yank copies the selected text into a buffer and holds it until another yank or deletion occurs. Yank is usually used in combination with a word or line object such as the ones shown below:


yw		copies a word into a buffer (7yw copies 7 words)
yy		copies a line into a buffer (3yy will copy 3 lines)


### Exit Commands

:wq 	Write file to disk and quit the editor
:q! 	Quit (no warning)
:q 		Quit (a warning is printed if a modified file has not been saved)
ZZ 		Save workspace and quit the editor (same as :wq)

numbers can be used. (Use :f to find out the line numbers you want.
